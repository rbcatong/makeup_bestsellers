# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application [I was able to create a cli folder within bestsellers and this was how the CLI was implemented]
- [x] Pull data from an external source[This is from scraping from the webpage ULTA and this was how I can display data.]
- [x] Implement both list and detail views[ This allows me to look at the categories of the items and to see the details, i'd be able to see the url for each item]
